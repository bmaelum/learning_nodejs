# Environment Setup

## Local Environment Setup
If you are still willing to set up your environment for Node.js, you need the following two softwares available on your computer:  
a) Text Editor  
b) The Node.js binary installables

##Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.

Name and version of text editor can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as Linux or UNIX.

The files you create with your editor are called source files and contain program source code. The source files for Node.js programs are typically named with the extension ".js".

Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, and finally execute it.

## The Node.js Runtime
The source code written in source file is simply javascript. The Node.js interpreter will be used to interpret and execute your javascript code.

Node.js distribution comes as a binary installable for SunOS , Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows operating systems with the 32-bit (386) and 64-bit (amd64) x86 processor architectures.

Following section guides you on how to install Node.js binary distribution on various OS.

## Verify installation: Executing a File
Create a js file named main.js on your machine (Windows or Linux) having the following code.
```javascript
/* Hello, World! program in node.js */
console.log("Hello, World!")
```
Now execute main.js file using Node.js interpreter to see the result âˆ’
```
$ node main.js
```
If everything is fine with your installation, this should produce the following result:
```
Hello, World!
```
